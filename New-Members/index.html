The Project would not be where it is today if it werent for the 3 teams that keep it going. The Mechanical Team is frsponsible for the electronics, the 3D printing/printers, and the Rover. They have to make it so the rover can run the program and
finish it in one piece. The Chemical Team is responsible for testing out different chemicals to see if they make them hydrophobic and if they do, to apply those chemicals
to the rover's electronics. The Programming Team is held accountable for making the program that sends the rover on a Mission, a group of waypoints that it executes, and 
have the rover execute the mission. These three teams make up the Summer Workshop at Montgomery County Community College.

**Mrudang Savsani:**

Mrudang is a valuble member of our team and has worked with quadcopters before so he knows the electronics involved in the rover. He also has experience 
with Google Sketchup and 3D printing so he is able to help make and print out parts for the Rover. While he has been a part of the team, he has learned how 
to use SolidWorks, another 3D design program for manufacturing, and how to work with the Makerbot and German RepRap Slicer 3D printers that we have. Some 
of his work includes the design for the front base plate, which he made on Google Sketchup, and some of the other plates on the rover. He enjoys designing 
and printing 3D models that he has created. He joined the workshop because he thought it would help him with his engineering career and give him experience.

**Brandon Shettsline:**

Brandon is another important member of our engineering team and has learned how to use SolidWorks, Google Sketchup, 3D Printing. He has also learned the 
mechanics of the Makerbot 3D Printer, and the German RepRap Slicer 3D Printer. Some of the things he has done include the back rear plate, the top plate, 
and the front plate. Brandon join the team because he wants to learn more about engineering, have something that looks good on his resume, and increase his 
skills and experience. He enjoys what he gets to do in the workshop and hopes to come back if it happens again next year.

**Nicholas Pleim**

Nick IS the chemical group. In his Senior year at North Penn High School he did engineering research in superconductive ceramic nanofibers, and joined
the team for more experience in research, which he hopes to do as a career. So far in the workshop, he has worked with hydrophobic and dielectric 
material to weatherize bare electronics. He is going to Penn State in the Fall for Materials Science and Engineering.


##**_Programming_**

**Anthony Brigidi**

Anthony is an important member of the Programming group and has learned how to code in Java, XML, HTML, and CSS. He has also learned how to use Jekyll, 
a static webdesigner, and Android Studio, an IDE for building android apps. He has also learned how to develop a website and create a working app in 
Java. He joined so he could get experience in programming and engineering and to learn more about how different engineers work together to make 
something that works. The thing he likes most about the workshop is how every day has a different task and how the pprogramming is always different and 
can be molded to do new things.

**Robert Nubla**

Robert is a vital member of the Programming team and he came to the workshop because he wanted to learn more and get more experience as an engineer. He 
also wants to see what it's like to be in a workshop and would like something that shows he has experience on his resume. He enjoys learning different 
things in the workshop and wants to expand his knowledge in Java even though he is also learning different programming languages. He wants to take 
advantage of this workshop and experience all that he can in this short period because it's free and it allows him to use his skills over the summer.
