#Overview
For 2014, the QuadForge project is making an ongoing effort towards producing durable, efficient, and easy to use quadrotors. Having demonstrated the successful weatherization process of our quads during the summer of 2013, we are now aiming to provide end users with an enhanced ground control application using only 6 buttons to control a quad from takeoff, returning to home, landing, and throughout its autonomous mission. In addition to this, our team also aims to discover an optimal configuration of motors, propellors, and electronic speed controllers in order to maximize the flight time of our quads. Lastly, in order to enable the quad to be better suited for long range missions, we are in the process of developing and building our own antennas to increase the range of telemetry transmissions and streaming video. Our team is comprised of several talented young students and engineers, based out of our flight labs in Montgomery County Community College.

#History
In the Fall of 2011 students at the Montgomery County Community College were encouraged to participate in an endeavor to promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educational opportunities by participating in a DARPA program related to UAV technologies; see www.uavforge.net. Research on these technologies was an initiative open to all at the international level, and students wanted to contribute their skills in the areas of “Power Distribution” to increase the operational flying time and “Flight Simulation” to define if certain missions could be executed in bad weather conditions, such as moderate wind, rain or snow. It was a modest start using a simple aluminum frame carrying an onboard digital power recorder for capturing data related to energy consumption.

In the Spring of 2012, the College received a government grant to explore a suitable autonomous platform capable of geolocation, mapping, communicating and retrieving data from a network of sensors storing telemetry and environmental events. The idea behind it was that this task could be efficiently achieved by autonomously flying a UAV over at-risk areas. Three quadrotors were successfully delivered in the Summer of 2012. The open source code was made public and can be freely downloaded from the openPicus Community projects.

During 2013, goals were ambitious as the students had already improved on the 2012 VTOL UAV platform. Upgraded electronics and avionics have been replaced by the current 2nd generation modules; upgraded avionics and electronics have replaced the current 2nd generation modules. New LiPo batteries have increased capacity; more efficient motors and propellers were tested; the UAV’s top plate was redesigned using our 3D printer to enlarge the available real estate; a First Person View (FPV) camera has been mounted in order to send live video streams to the ground control monitor; the mission computer is now ported to an Android-based device; electronics, radio, and video components have been encapsulated using our 3D printer, and protected by a silicone gel for waterproofing; in addition to this, we are using a super-hydrophobic nanotechnology coating in order to fully weatherize our quads.

#The Black Bat
The Black Bat is the name given the quadrotor prototype that is currently being developed in the EGR 292 class.

The Black Bat is the next generation of quadrotor developed by the QuadForge Project team. With the Spring 2013 semester, the QuadForge team hopes to implement a host of new technologies to produce a quadrotor capable of performing a mission with an extended, autonomous outdoor flight in harsh conditions.

The Black Bat quad features the latest technologies at QuadForge’s disposal. With it’s sleek black finish, the Black Bat will be equipped with 3D printed plates to expand the surface area the quad has to mount components. All the avionics and devices on the Black Bat will have housings for them to ensure the safety of the components. From the first person view (FPV) system to the Android powered mission computer, the Black Bat has everything it needs to complete many missions.

The Black Bat represents the countless hours and dedication the students at QuadForge put into their work. With hard earned lessons and two years of work under their belts, students have been able to transform a simple aluminum frame quadrotor into the innovative and multi-purpose technology that is the Black Bat.

#Mission Computer
One of the major objectives of the QuadForge Project is to provide a flight platform capable of Wifi and 3G or 4G connectivity. The mission computer, attached to the quad, provides this connectivity. In addition, the computer allows real-time access to GPS data and provides the possibility of over 30 gigabytes of data storage.

Over the course of the project, a number of candidates for the mission computer were tested. Originally in the summer of 2012, a Flyport module was successfully programmed to perform a proof of concept mission, but it lacked sufficient internal storage space as well as 3G and GPS capabilities.

A vital task of the QuadForge project is to provide a flight platform capable of data transmissions. To accomplish this, the mission computer had to be capable of mass removable storage, Wi-Fi and GSM connectivity. For this reason, it was decided that an Android capable device would be the most cost efficient, as well as practical solution, to function as the mission computer.

The application being designed for the Android-based device must be able to perform an array of tasks related to data retrieval using a number of different information transfer protocols. The primary purpose of the mission computer is to allow the quadrotor to automatically connect to wireless hotspots to send and receive data.

Because the mission computer is an Android-capable device, access to 3G or 4G networks is also possible. This allows missions that require access to the internet, but are out of range of wireless hotspots, to continue as long as network coverage is available. This also means that real-time access to GPS and other data that typical Android-based devices track. Additionally, because the device will be mounted to the bottom of the quadrotor, photos of terrain below will be available.

As Android devices become an ever increasingly powerful platform to program for, new opportunities for automated missions abound. The Android development environment provides standardized access and interfacing to anything available on the mobile operating system.

The end goal for the mission computer is to provide a flexible environment that can be easily configured to perform a number of different missions with varying parameters. Development of the Android application will continue to be a major focal point of the project and the versatility and usability of the application will be constantly improved as new ideas and applications are discovered.

#3D Encapsulation and Nanotechnologies
One of the problems faced by the team was that the quadrotor could only be flown in good weather because all of the electronics were completely exposed. To fix this, CAD software and 3D printing capabilities are being utilized to create encapsulations for each of the components. These pieces are completely protecting the delicate components from the elements. Dielectric gels are being used to fill in the gaps between the components as well as their casings, making for a perfect seal.

The 3D printer makes real the images created by the CAD software. It uses spools of very thin plastic wiring to lay out the 3D image downloaded into the machine. It works like a hot glue gun if one were to use it to build something from the bottom up. The 3D printer feeds this plastic wire through a hot chamber that melts it and then lays it down layer by layer on a tray in the machine until the piece is complete. When using CAD software, you are creating 3D images on a 2D surface. Some things may be overlooked during the design process so one will have to redesign the part. There is a lot of trial and error involved.

Some of the things that have been designed so far are a top plate for the quad and a case for a telemetry module. The top plate was redesigned to create more real estate on the top of the quad. The case for the telemetry module needed to protect it but also provide access by probe to check the function of the component.

Some problems have come up in choosing a dielectric gel. Majority of the gels available require heat curing for a specific amount of time. In most cases, the heat required is so hot it will bake the electronics and they will not work anymore. We will need to try a variety of gels before deciding which one to stick with.

#Automation and Avionics
QuadForge’s UAVs all run off of one ground station: the ArduMission planner. The ArduMission planner is a powerful piece of software offering seamless communication between pilot and aircraft. With its simple point and click placement of waypoints and commands, the ArduMission planner makes programing autonomous flights a straightforward task. The ArduMission planner offers a range of commands for a quad to accomplish a variety of jobs. From loitering to following a GPS waypoint, the ArduMission planner is a convenient and powerful way to manage autonomous flights.

Featuring real time telemetry flight data, the ArduMission planner presents the most important information a pilot needs for a flight in an efficient and intuitive manner. Logs are kept of every flight so that pilots can look back on flights and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of their flight platforms. The log data is presented in easy to read diagrams and graphs. All in all the ArduMission planner makes for easy to program autonomous missions and gives pilots complete control of their birds.

#Research and Methodologies
As vertical takeoff and landing unmanned aerial vehicles (VTOL UAV) become more prevalent, their lack of endurance becomes more of a barrier to successful usage. Before this challenge can be overcome it must be better understood. While various anecdotal resources exist to extend the endurance of a VTOL UAV there has been little testing done to empirically determine the best mechanical and flight characteristics of a VTOL UAV. To this end, the students at Montgomery County Community College have developed experiments to measure the power consumption of a quadrotor as a function of its mechanical and flight characteristics.

In the spring of 2012 the students of Montgomery County Community College endeavored to determine the appropriate power supply for a UAV that could fly for 30 minutes while weighing 1.5 kg. This previous attempt showed that a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) battery was unable to meet the mission requirements stated above. Our current experiments are a continuation of these as we try to find the best mechanical flight characteristics for quadrotor endurance.
