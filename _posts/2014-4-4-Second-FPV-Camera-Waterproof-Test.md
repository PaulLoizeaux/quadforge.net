The success of the <a href="http://www.quadforge.net/news/?id=3">first underwater test</a> proved that a camera, not designed for underwater use, could successfully be sealed.

Upon the arrival of silicone dielectric gel kits, the encapsulation team tested out the waterproofing capabilities of the Dow Corning 3-4207 gel on the first person view camera.

The camera was carefully coated with gel, powered on, and then submerged for over twenty minutes while streaming to a remote monitor. After retrieving the camera from the water, the team let it run for an hour before concluding that no damage had been sustained.

The success of this test means that the encapsulation team will be looking into more ways of utilizing the unique properties of the gels.
