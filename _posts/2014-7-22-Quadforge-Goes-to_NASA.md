On June 25th 2014, two engineering and research students from Montgomery County Community College students, Paul and Nate, both traveled to Wallops Island, Virginia, to experience the NASA RockOn rocket launch. RockOn is a week-long workshop that NASA supports by giving 61 college and university students the opportunity to build a small custom built payload that collects data. Each of these payloads is incorporated into a NASA Terrier-Improved Orion suborbital sounding rocket that launches nearly 70 miles into the atmosphere.

Weighing in at a little under 3,000 pounds and over 40 feet long this suborbital rocket was quite a massive undertaking. After hours of research, planning, and hard work, the RockOn team was successful: on June 26th, 2014 the team finally heard those two magic words “blast off.” In the hours following the launch, the rocket payload was retrieved from the Atlantic Ocean, and the payloads examined by the students.

Nate and Paul would like to thank the QuadForge team, Temple University, Penn State University, and NASA who made this unforgettable trip a possibility.
