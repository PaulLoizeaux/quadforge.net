This is the continuation of underwater testing after the encouraging test of the First Person View (FPV) camera done on April 4, 2013.

We demonstrated that we could immerse both the telemetry module and the FPV streaming video module and their respective antennas, and still have an exploitable data transmission.

Both modules were coated with the Dow Corning 3-4207 gel, powered on, and then submerged for over 15 minutes. The telemetry module was transmitting data to APM Mission Planner and the FPV module was streaming to a remote monitor.

The purpose of these tests was to ensure that the antenna grounding was not causing disruptions as the antenna connectors are left unprotected. This is important as the quads will be flying in moderate rain or could be left sitting in the rain for extended periods of time.
