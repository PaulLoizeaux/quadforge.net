The researchers at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) are making strides in fuel cell research, focusing on designing soldier portable fuel cells allowing the ground soldiers to carry less batteries and equipment to maintain their electronic devices.

Today, there are currently no fuel cells that fit the specifications for an onboard power supply that the Black Bat quad would require. The systems that have the power output we are looking for are simply too large and heavy to be mounted on a quad. Those that are small enough to be mounted don’t meet the quad’s power requirements. On the other hand, fuel cells offer the exciting prospect of powering the mission ground control. While we cannot use fuel cells on quads, current fuel cell technology would allow us to use them for ground applications.

The visit to Aberdeen Proving Ground excited us about the future possibilities of fuel cells.
