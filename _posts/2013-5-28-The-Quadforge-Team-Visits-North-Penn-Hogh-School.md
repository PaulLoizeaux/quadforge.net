On Wednesday May 22 2013, the QuadForge team visited North Penn High School to meet up with their Model Aviation Club on a community outreach mission. Dr. Michael Voicheck, the club advisor and electronics teacher at NPHS, and the students of the club showed off their RC craft that they have been working on this year. They recently had purchased a quadrotor with the Naza flight controller, GPS module and camera in a simple “I” frame setup.

One student of the Model Aviation Club will be graduating from NPHS this coming June and will be attending MCCC in the fall. A few of them have already begun making plans to join us in our research this summer.

The NPHS Model Aviation Club has also been extended an offer to visit MCCC and tour our labs. Hopefully it will be a nice day in which we could demonstrate our quad’s capabilities to the Model Aviation Club and also give them a chance to fly their own craft as well. Overall it was a pleasure to visit students who enjoy model aviation as a hobby and hopefully we where able to get them thinking more about autonomous flight and quadrotors in general.
