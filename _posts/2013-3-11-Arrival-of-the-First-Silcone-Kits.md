In our continuing effort to weatherize our Black Bat quad, Dow Corning through one of their distributors, Krayden of Westminster, CO sent us two silicone kits. These products will replace the Sugru encapsulant used for the streaming FPV camera.

The two products received are:

Dow Corning 186 silicone elastomer, a two-part translucent encapsulant curing at room temperature featuring high tear strength.
Dow Corning 3-4207, a dielectric tough gel, is a two-part translucent gel curing at room temperature featuring primerless chemical adhesion and UL 94 v-1 flammability classification.

These two products will soon be tested and a research report will be generated.
