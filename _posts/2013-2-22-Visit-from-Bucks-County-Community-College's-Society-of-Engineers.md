On Friday, Feb. 22, 2013 the QuadForge team was visited by the Bucks County Community College Society of Engineers. This event was organized by Montgomery County Community College, Prof. William Brownlowe and Bucks County Community College Prof. Christine Delahanty.

Prof. Brownlowe invited the BCCC to participate in the “Quadrotor Challenge” inaugural day that will be held on April 10 during the MCCC STEM Jam 2013. The MCCC students’ Black Bat research team will demonstrate a prototype of their next gen quadrotor. It is anticipated that the BCCC students will exhibit their own quadrotor. The actual competition will take place in the Spring of 2014.

I was very pleased to see that students of both colleges got together quickly to share their visions and goals. I strongly encourage them to keep this momentum alive as fostering ideas between communities is crucial for future engineers.

Thank you for your participation, you made my day enjoyable!
