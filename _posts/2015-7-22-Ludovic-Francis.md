Ludovic (Ludo) Francis, is an 18-year old French exchange student from Toulouse, France, who spent his entire senior year at North Penn High School in Lansdale, PA. Ludo has experience living in different countries, and the USA stands out as one of his favorites.

He visited Philadelphia and New York with the German exchange students who came to North Penn. German exchange programs have played a major role in Ludo’s travels. In fact, two years ago, he took advantage of a German exchange program offered in his high school and spent three months in Germany. Now, he is totally at ease with the idea of travelling across the globe while still keeping in touch with his family.
Ludo is now back at his home in Toulouse, where he has one sister who is 16 years old. While he enjoys travel, he looks fondly on life in France as well. Looking to the future, Ludo hopes toulstercyny
 become an aeronautical engineer. He will be returning to his high school in September, Lycée Pierre de Fermat in Toulouse. Pierre de Fermat was a French mathematician (1601-1665).
Ludo is currently participating, online from France, in an engineering research summer workshop held at Montgomery County Community College (mc3.edu) in Blue Bell, PA. Like other local students attending the workshop, he will be designing parts for the first autonomous rover prototype, these parts will then be printed on one the four 3D printers at the college.
This is going to be an interesting challenge for all of us!
