On Wednesday, April 10, 2013 the Bucks County Community College Society of Engineers visited STEM Jam. This event was organized by Montgomery County Community College, Prof. William Brownlowe, and Bucks County Community College Prof. Christine Delahanty.

The BCCC students worked on their quadrotor VTOL UAV for about seven weeks before bringing it to STEM Jam. They use the DJI Flame Wheel 450 with DJI ESC’s and motors with the ArduPilot Mega version 2.5 as their autopilot system, powered by the 3DR power module and a UBLOX GPS. Other hardware that they used on the quad was a Raspberry Pi board, 4G hotspot device, and a web cam for OSD. Their ground station consists of a laptop connected to the Internet via a 4G Freedom Pop mobile hotspot device. The quadrotor then connects to the Internet via 4G connection and is then controlled by a user through a website. Through the website they are able to plan auto missions, track the craft’s progress, and view the webcam’s video. The Raspberry Pi is used to manage the in/out data from the quad: video signal, GPS position and other telemetry data, and then sent through the 4G hotspot device to the website.

Thank you for your participation, you made our event an enjoyable day!
