Brushless motors can run underwater. We demonstrated by immersing a motor for over 10 minutes in tap water which has almost no conductive properties.

Once the test was successfully completed, we dried the motor by running it (without the propellers) for a couple of minutes in order to eliminate the residual water inside the casing.

The final touch was to spray the motor with a military-grade lubricant in order to protect the motorâ€™s precision bearings. We use CorrosionX , an advanced corrosion and rust fighter, probably the best lubricating and penetrating oil on the market.
